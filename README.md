# Overview

I've always wanted to make a video game, and so I decided to try and strengthen my skills as a software designer by learning how to make one! This is the first of hopefully many.

This game is pretty simple. It consists of a cat character that you control via keyboard and make jump from platform to platform. The objective of the game is to reach the highest platform possible, and if you fall off, you lose the game.

The purpose of the software is just to provide entertainment. The cat in the game is inspired by my roommate's cat, Todd, who loves to jump up to all the shelves in our apartment.
